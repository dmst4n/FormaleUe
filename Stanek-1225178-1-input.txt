;Exercise 1: Defines two boolean variables p and q, 
;		     two functions phi1 and phi2,
;			 and an IFF function which will be negated and checked by the sat solver
; 			 The output is unsat therefore IFF is true.
;            z3 treats (and (=> f1 f2) (=> f2 f1)) with (= f1 f2)
(declare-const p Bool)
(declare-const q Bool)
(define-fun phi1 () Bool
  (=> p q)
)
(define-fun phi2 () Bool
  (=> (not q) (not p))
)
(define-fun IFF () Bool
  (and 
    (=> phi1 phi2)
    (=> phi2 phi1)
  )
)
(assert(not IFF))
